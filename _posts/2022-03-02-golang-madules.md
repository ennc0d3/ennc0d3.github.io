# Golang Modules (yeah! madules, go mad)
This is one of things i am starting to hate about in Golang, the documentation
is too long and boring. I had not problems using it go modules until i had to
understand the contents of go.mod files, specially the indirect dependencies.

I am on version go1.17.7 and go modules was introduced in go1.11, so it is been
while, but i still think the tooling to find dependencies (deep dependencies)
are still confusing, i admit, probably it is my lack of understanding but at 
the same time i wonder why it is hard.

I blame the documentation and the migration and compability of dependencies that
are not opted to go modules. I think i need to work through and example to get a
good understanding on the topic.

But, while i try to learn more. I found this article quite crisp on the most of
the topics on [go modules tidbits](https://dev.to/zaracooper/18-essential-go-module-tidbits-for-a-newbie-4455)
