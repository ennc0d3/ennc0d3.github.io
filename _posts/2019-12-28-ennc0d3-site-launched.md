Steve Jobs famously said; “Real artists ship”. He was referring to the fact that everyone has ideas, but real artists deliver on them or ship them, as he put it.

I think myself being creative, experimental, dreamer and what not, but i always had tough time putting things better and delivering things as i imagined. What I Get Is Not What I Want (WIGINWIW). 

I had made quite many attempts to create and maintain a blog, have tried blogger, gh-pages, wordpress, google sites (from google drive), what not and as always either I didn't like the process of writing or the tools or the combination of two. I was looking for something similar to github pages where it is possible to write using Markdown and still looks neat and this time my search ended up to use github.io (gh-pages) with Jekyll (static site generator) and beautiful-jekyll theme.

Finally I managed to put this webpage on github.io. Neat thing about it - powered by [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) and I can use Markdown to author my posts. It actually is a lot easier than I thought it was going to be.
